## Summary of the Basic Characteristics of a Communist Society

### 1. Abundant Material Wealth and Distribution of Consumer Goods According to Need

#### 1. Highly Developed Productive Forces

- The vast abundance of material wealth and the highly developed productive forces are necessary conditions for the realization of communism.
- Engels pointed out in the "Draft of a Communist Confession of Faith" that the implementation of communism relies on highly developed productivity and abundant means of subsistence in industries like agriculture and trade.
- Marx and Engels acknowledged in "The Communist Manifesto" the achievements of capitalism in developing productive forces and believed that these achievements laid the material foundation for the realization of communism.
- In a communist society, productive forces will develop even further, with the social ownership and collective management of the means of production meeting the needs of all people.

#### 2. Transformation of Production Relations

- A communist society will abolish private ownership, establishing universal public ownership of the means of production and eliminating private property.
- A union of free and equal workers will collectively own and use the means of production, forming a system where society directly possesses the means of production.
- Production will be organized and managed according to a planned system to meet the needs of society, with individual labor no longer converted into social labor through equivalent exchange.

#### 3. Distribution Principle

- The initial phase will implement the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work," while the advanced phase will realize "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs."
- The distribution principle in the advanced stage of communism will achieve true equality in distribution, transcending the limitations of labor as the standard of distribution, and meeting the needs of every person.

### 2. Highly Harmonious Social Relations and Great Improvement in People's Spiritual Realm

#### 1. The Disappearance of Classes

- With the highly developed productive forces and the fundamental alignment of social members' interests, classes will disappear, class exploitation and oppression will cease to exist, and class struggle will vanish.

#### 2. The Withering Away of the State

- The state, as a tool of class oppression, will wither away. Social management institutions will transform into self-management structures, no longer having the functions of political oppression and violent repression.

#### 3. The End of War

- With the disappearance of classes and the state, wars will no longer exist, freeing up vast social resources from military activities to benefit all of society.

#### 4. The Disappearance of the "Three Great Differences"

- The differences between industry and agriculture, between urban and rural areas, and between mental and physical labor will fade away. The disappearance of these three great contradictions is a significant characteristic of a communist society.

#### 5. Harmony Between Society and Nature

- In a communist society, humanity will transform and utilize nature in a way that accords with natural development laws. Material production will harmonize with human needs, achieving harmony between humanity and nature.

#### 6. Great Improvement in People's Spiritual Realm

- People's spiritual realm will greatly improve, characterized by a conscious commitment to serving others, the collective, and society. High moral qualities will become a conscious attribute of individuals.

### 3. Realization of the Free and Comprehensive Development of Every Individual, Marking Humanity's Leap from the Realm of Necessity to the Realm of Freedom

This section summarizes the core views of communist society and Marxist theory, emphasizing several key aspects:

1. **Free and Comprehensive Development:**
   In a communist society, individual development is free and comprehensive. This means that everyone has the opportunity to fully realize their potential, free from class and economic constraints, achieving personalized growth and overall ability enhancement.

2. **Elimination of Old Division of Labor:**
   Communist society will eliminate the rigid division of labor under capitalism, allowing people to participate freely in diverse forms of productive labor and social activities without being confined to a single function.

3. **Free Time and Creative Activities:**
   With technological advancement and increased production efficiency, the amount of labor time individuals need to contribute will decrease. Consequently, people will have more free time to engage in creative activities such as science and art, promoting the comprehensive development of individual qualities.

4. **Transformation of Labor:**
   In a communist society, labor will no longer be merely a means of livelihood but will become a way for individuals to realize themselves and contribute to society. Labor will be a voluntary activity that brings joy and satisfaction to individuals.

5. **Humanity's Historical Leap:**
   A communist society represents a historical leap for humanity from being dominated and oppressed by external forces to achieving liberation from the kingdom of necessity and entering the kingdom of freedom. Individuals will no longer be bound by the objective laws of history but will actively participate in and shape the historical process.
