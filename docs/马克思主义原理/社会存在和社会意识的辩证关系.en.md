# The dialectical relationship between social existence and social consciousness

### 1. Social existence determines social consciousness

- **Social existence is the objective source of the content of social consciousness**: Social existence determines social consciousness, and social consciousness is a reflection of social existence. Social consciousness is rooted in social existence and is a reflection of the real world that is constantly changing and developing based on practice.

- **Social practice is the basis of social consciousness**: Human social practice is the basis for the emergence of social consciousness, and the initiative of practice determines the initiative of social consciousness to reflect social existence.

### 2. The emergence and development of social consciousness

- **The formation of initial consciousness**: The initial consciousness of human beings was generated in material production and communication activities, and it was a "pure animal consciousness". With the development of production and communication, accompanied by the division of mental and physical labor, the first thinkers of human beings were born, and consciousness began to be independent of the world, constructing "pure" theories, theology, philosophy, morality, etc.

- **Changes in consciousness**: People who develop their own material production and material communication are changing their own thinking and the products of thinking while changing this reality. Life determines consciousness.

### 3. The concreteness and historicity of social consciousness

- **Social consciousness changes with the development of social existence**: The development of social existence determines the changes in social consciousness. For example, in primitive society, there was only a simple concept of public ownership, while the concept of private ownership emerged with the emergence of private ownership of the means of production.

- **The dependence of social consciousness on social existence**: Social consciousness reflects social existence in the form of theory, concept, psychology, etc., and social existence determines social consciousness.

### 4. The relative independence of social consciousness

- **Incomplete synchronization and imbalance**: Social consciousness and social existence are not completely synchronized. Progressive social consciousness can foresee the future and guide practice; backward social consciousness hinders development. In some economically backward regions, some aspects of their social consciousness may be ahead of economically developed regions.

- **Internal forms of mutual influence and historical inheritance**: Various forms within social consciousness influence each other, and each has historical inheritance and unique laws of development.

- **Active reaction**: Social consciousness has an active reaction to social existence, which can be transformed into material force under certain conditions and affect historical development. Advanced social consciousness promotes social development, while backward social consciousness hinders social development.

### 5. The active role of social consciousness

- **Realization through practice**: To realize ideas, they must be realized through practical power, and the subject of social practice is the masses. The degree and scope of the role of social consciousness are closely related to the depth and breadth of its actual grasp of the masses.
