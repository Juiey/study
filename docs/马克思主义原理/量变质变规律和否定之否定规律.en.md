# The law of quantitative change and qualitative change and the law of negation of negation

**The law of quantitative change and qualitative change and the law of negation of negation reveal the state, process and trend of the change and development of things, and show that the change and development of things is a process of unity of gradualness and leap, progress and twists and turns. **

#### 1. The law of quantitative change and qualitative change

**1. The quality, quantity and degree of things**

- **Quality**: The inherent determination of one thing that distinguishes it from other things.
- **Quantity**: The scale, degree, speed, etc. of things can be expressed in quantitative relationships.
- **Degree**: The quantitative limit that maintains the stability of something, that is, the limit, magnitude and scope of something. The two ends of the degree are called joint points or critical points. Beyond the range of the degree, things are transformed into other things.

**2. Quantitative change and qualitative change**

- **Quantitative change**: The increase or decrease in the number of things and the change in the arrangement of the constituent elements are insignificant changes that maintain the relative stability of the matter and reflect the continuity of the gradual development process of things.
- **Qualitative change**: The fundamental change in the nature of things is the leap of things from one qualitative state to another, which reflects the gradual process of development of things and the interruption of continuity.

**3. Dialectical relationship between quantitative change and qualitative change**

- **Quantitative change is the necessary preparation for qualitative change**: Any change in things has an accumulation process of quantitative change. Without the accumulation of quantitative change, qualitative change will not occur.
- **Qualitative change is the inevitable result of quantitative change**: Pure quantitative change will not last forever. Quantitative change reaching a certain level will inevitably cause qualitative change and open the way for new quantitative change.
- **Interpenetration of quantitative change and qualitative change**: In the process of overall quantitative change, there are staged and partial partial qualitative changes; in the process of qualitative change, there is also the quantitative contraction of old quality and the quantitative expansion of new quality. Quantitative change and qualitative change are interdependent and interconnected. Quantitative change causes qualitative change. On the basis of new quality, things begin new quantitative changes. This alternating cycle constitutes the development process of things.

**4. Methodological significance**

- **Quantitative change stage**: When the development of things is in the quantitative change stage, you must do your daily work in a down-to-earth manner to prepare for major changes in the future.
- **Qualitative change is coming**: When qualitative change comes, we must seize the opportunity decisively and without losing the opportunity to promote qualitative change and take our work to a new level.

#### 2. The law of negation of negation

**1. The basic concept of negation and the law of negation**

- **Inner contradictory movement and self-negation**: The development of things is achieved in a self-negating manner through its inner contradictory movement. Everything contains positive and negative aspects. Due to the interaction between the two contradictory parties, when the negative aspect rises to a dominant position, the thing will move from affirmation to negation of itself, and then from negation to a higher stage. Affirmation is the negation of negation.

**2. The profound connotation of the law of negation**

- **Self-negation, self-development**: Negation is the self-negation and self-development of things, and is the result of the internal contradictory movement of things.
- **The link of development**: Negation is the link in the development of things, the transformation of old things into new things, and the leap from old quality to new quality. Only through negation can old things transform into new things.
- **Connection between old and new things**: Negation is the link between old and new things. New things are born from old things, and new and old things are connected through the link of negation.
- **The essence of dialectical negation is "sublation"**: new things both criticize and inherit old things, overcome their negative factors while retaining their positive factors.

**3. Methodological significance**

- **Scientific Analysis Attitude**: We must adopt a scientific analysis attitude towards everything. We must grasp both its current status and its development trend, and oppose simply affirming everything or denying everything.
- **Cultural inheritance and innovation**: For Chinaâ€™s excellent traditional culture, we must not only pay attention to inheritance, but also achieve creative transformation and innovative development according to the requirements of the times. We should neither copy nor reject the cultural achievements of other nations, but should critically absorb their reasonable elements and use them for our own use.

**4. The process of negation of negation**

- **Two negations, three stages**: The dialectical negation of things is not completed at one time, but goes through two negations and three stages of self-development of things, that is, the regular pattern of "affirmation-negation-negation of negation" process.
- **Progressivity and Tortuousness**: Progressivity is reflected in the fact that every negation is a qualitative change, pushing things to a new stage; every cycle is open, and the end of the previous cycle is the starting point of the next cycle. Tortuousness is reflected in resilience, with temporary pauses or even regressions.

**5. Progress and twists and turns in historical development**

- **General Trend**: The general trend of social and historical development is forward, and human beings will never stop moving forward.
- **Bumps and twists**: The realization of this general trend is not smooth sailing, but full of bumps and twists. We must firmly believe that social history is a process of continuous development and never lose the confidence and courage to forge ahead at any time. At the same time, we must attach great importance to and take seriously the twists and turns in progress, and promote social development while responding to challenges and resolving contradictions.
