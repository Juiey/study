### The Law of Unity and Struggle of Opposites: The Fundamental Law of Development of Things

The development and change of things follow certain laws, which are revealed by dialectical materialism. It identifies three general laws of change and development: the law of the unity and struggle of opposites, the law of the transformation of quantity into quality, and the law of the negation of the negation. Among these, the law of the unity and struggle of opposites is the fundamental law.

The law of unity and struggle of opposites is the essence and core of dialectical materialism. This law reveals the fundamental content of the universal connection between things and the internal driving force of change and development. It fundamentally answers the question of why things develop. The law of unity and struggle of opposites also serves as the central thread that runs through the law of the transformation of quantity into quality, the law of the negation of the negation, and the basic categories of dialectical materialism, making it the "key" to understanding these laws. Moreover, this law provides the fundamental method for understanding and transforming the worldâ€”the method of analyzing contradictions. Therefore, in the process of understanding and transforming the world, consciously adhering to and correctly applying the law of unity and struggle of opposites is of great importance.

### The Identity and Struggle of Contradictions and Their Role in Development

#### 1. Basic Concepts

**Contradiction** is a philosophical category that reflects the relationship of unity and opposition within a thing or between things. Contradiction encompasses two basic properties:

- **Identity**: The nature and tendency of the opposite sides of a contradiction to be mutually dependent and interpenetrative.
  - **Mutual Dependence**: The opposite sides of a contradiction depend on each other for existence and coexist within a unified entity. For example, yin and yang coexist and are indispensable to each other.
  - **Mutual Penetration**: The opposite sides of a contradiction can transform into each other under certain conditions, such as the alternation between day and night.
  
- **Struggle**: The nature and tendency of the opposite sides of a contradiction to repel and separate from each other. The struggle can manifest as antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions.
  - **Antagonistic Contradictions**: Such as class contradictions, which manifest as intense struggle between opposing sides.
  - **Non-antagonistic Contradictions**: Such as differences between friends, where contradictions exist but can be resolved through communication.

#### 2. Interrelationship

- The identity and struggle of contradictions are interdependent and complementary.
  - **No struggle, no identity**: Without struggle, the identity of the contradictory sides cannot manifest or develop.
  - **No identity, no struggle**: Without identity, the opposite sides of a contradiction cannot coexist and struggle within a unified entity.
  
- **Identity is conditional and relative; struggle is unconditional and absolute**:
  - Identity exists under certain conditions and may disappear as conditions change.
  - Struggle is always present and is absolute.

#### 3. Role in Development

- **Role of Identity**:
  - **Precondition for Existence and Development**: The mutual dependence of the opposite sides of a contradiction allows them to develop together. For example, productivity and production relations promote each other under certain conditions.
  - **Mutual Absorption of Beneficial Factors**: The opposite sides of a contradiction absorb each other's strengths, promoting their own development.
  - **Possibility and Trend of Transformation**: The mutual penetration of the opposite sides determines the direction and trend of development.

- **Role of Struggle**:
  - **Promoting the Change of Forces**: The struggle between the opposite sides changes the balance of power, creating conditions for qualitative change.
  - **Driving the Transformation of the Old and New Unified Entities**: The struggle of contradictions leads to the breakdown of the old unified entity and the formation of a new one, such as the transition from old to new societies.

#### 4. Application in Practice

- **Understanding the Role of Harmony in Development**:
  - Harmony is a special manifestation of contradiction, reflecting the mutual dependence, promotion, and development of the opposite sides.
  - Harmony is relative and conditional, requiring constant resolution of contradictions to achieve.
  
- **Promoting the Spirit of Struggle**:
  - Struggle is the driving force of development. Facing challenges requires courage and skill in struggle.
  - In the new era, achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation requires a new historical struggle.

### The Universality and Particularity of Contradictions and Their Interrelationship

#### 1. Basic Concepts

**Universality of Contradictions**: Contradictions exist in all things and throughout the entire process of their development.

- Contradictions are omnipresent and omnipresent, for example, social development is always accompanied by various contradictions, such as class contradictions and interest contradictions.

**Particularity of Contradictions**: The contradictions of specific things and their aspects have distinct characteristics at different stages of development.

- The particularity of contradictions determines the different nature of things, for example, economic contradictions manifest differently in different social forms.

**Primary and Secondary Contradictions**:

- **Primary Contradiction**: The contradiction that dominates and determines the development of things within a system of contradictions, for example, the primary contradiction in society determines the basic nature and direction of social development.
- **Secondary Contradiction**: The contradiction that is subordinate and plays a secondary role in the development of things.

**Main and Secondary Aspects of Contradictions**:

- **Main Aspect**: The dominant and leading side in a contradiction.
- **Secondary Aspect**: The subordinate and non-dominant side in a contradiction. The nature of things is determined by the main aspect of the primary contradiction.

#### 2. Interrelationship

- **Relationship Between Universality and Particularity**:
  - The universality of contradictions, or their generality, is unconditional and absolute.
  - The particularity of contradictions, or their individuality, is conditional and relative.
  - The generality of contradictions is embodied in individuality, and there is no generality without individuality, nor individuality without generality.

- **Dialectical Unity**:
  - Universality and particularity are interdependent and together constitute the movement of contradictions in things.
  - Understanding the universality and particularity of contradictions is key to mastering dialectical materialism.

#### 3. Application in Practice

- **Adhering to the Unity of "Two-point Theory" and "Key-point Theory"**:
  - **"Two-point Theory"**: In analyzing contradictions, one must see both the opposition and unity of the contradictory sides, and recognize both the primary and secondary contradictions.
  - **"Key-point Theory"**: Focus on the primary contradiction and its main aspect as the starting point for solving problems.
  - A balanced perspective is essential, yet it is also crucial to grasp the main trends and directions of development.

#### 4. Application of Marxism

- **Marxism and Chinese Practice**:
  - The dialectical relationship between the universality and particularity of contradictions forms the philosophical foundation of combining Marxism with the realities of different countries.
  - The Communist Party of China combines the basic principles of Marxism with China's specific reality and excellent traditional culture, promoting the sinicization and modernization of Marxism.
  - Theoretical innovation and practical development complement each other, driving the great victories of China's revolution, construction, and reform.
