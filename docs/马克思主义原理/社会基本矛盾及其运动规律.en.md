# Basic social contradictions and their laws of movement

#### Contradictions between productivity and production relations, economic base and superstructure

The contradictions between productivity and production relations, economic base and superstructure are the basic contradictions of human society. The laws of these contradictory movements are the basic laws of social development. It is of great significance to understand and master these basic contradictions and laws.

#### (I) The contradictory movement between productivity and production relations and their laws

**1. The concept and elements of productivity**

- **Productivity** refers to the material force formed by human beings in production practice to transform and influence nature to adapt to social needs. Productivity has objective reality and social history.

- Productivity includes means of labor (tools of production), objects of labor and laborers.

- **Methods of labor**: tools or material conditions used in the labor process, and production tools are the most important part.

- **Objects of labor**: the part of natural materials that enter the production process, which is a necessary prerequisite for production.

- **Laborers**: people with production experience, skills and knowledge are the most active factors in productivity

**2. The role of science and technology in productivity**

- **Science and technology** are important factors in productivity, which can trigger changes in labor materials, labor objects and the quality of laborers.

- The development and application of science and technology have a huge driving force on the development of productivity, and are the concentrated embodiment and main symbol of advanced productivity.

**3. The relationship between productivity and production relations**

- **Production relations** are economic relations formed by people in the process of material production, including the ownership of means of production, the relationship between people in production and the distribution of products.

- Production relations are the product of the development of productivity. Productivity determines production relations, and production relations react on productivity:

- When production relations adapt to the requirements of productivity development, they promote the development of productivity.

- When production relations do not adapt to the requirements of productivity development, they will hinder the development of productivity.

**4. The law of the contradictory movement of productivity and production relations**

- **Law**: Production relations must be suitable for the status of productivity. The development of productivity determines the changes in production relations, and production relations adapt to the requirements of productivity development to promote productivity development, and vice versa.

- **Significance**: This law provides the standard of social progress and the basis for judging the changes of the times. Marxist parties should base their policies on this law and formulate lines, principles and policies to promote productivity and social progress.

#### (II) The contradictory movement of the economic base and the superstructure and its laws

**1. The concept of economic base and superstructure**

- **Economic base**: The sum of production relations determined by the productivity of a certain stage of social development.

- **Superstructure**: Ideology based on a certain economic base and the corresponding systems, organizations and facilities, including political and legal systems, political parties, and the military.

**2. The economic base determines the superstructure**

- The economic base is the material basis for the emergence, existence and development of the superstructure. The nature of the economic base determines the nature of the superstructure, and changes in the economic base will inevitably lead to changes in the superstructure.

**3. The reaction of the superstructure to the economic base**

- The superstructure serves its own economic base, consolidates and maintains the dominant position of the economic base.

- The reaction of the superstructure to the economic base may promote or hinder social development.

**4. Contradictory movement between economic base and superstructure**

- The contradictory movement between superstructure and economic base is the basic law of social development.
- This contradictory movement is manifested as the law that the superstructure must be adapted to the economic base, that is, the economic base determines the direction of development of the superstructure, and the reaction of the superstructure depends on the nature and requirements of the economic base.

**5. Practical significance**

- In contemporary China, to understand this law, we must correctly grasp the interest relationship in the contradictory movement between the economic base and the superstructure, promote economic system reform and reform in the superstructure field, promote the development of productivity and the consolidation of the economic base, and achieve comprehensive social progress.
