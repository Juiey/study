# The Decisive Role of the People in the Process of Creating History

The masses are the subject of social history and the creators of history. This is one of the most basic viewpoints of Marxism. In terms of quality, the masses refer to all people who play a driving role in the development of social history; in terms of quantity, the masses refer to the vast majority of the social population. The masses are a historical category. In different historical periods, the masses have different contents, including different classes, strata and groups, but the most stable main part of them has always been the working people engaged in the production of material resources. In contemporary China, all socialist workers, builders of socialist cause, patriots who support socialism, patriots who support the reunification of the motherland and are committed to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation belong to the category of the masses.

### The decisive role of the masses in the development of social history

1. **The subject of social historical practice**
The masses are the subject of social historical practice and play a decisive role in creating history. The role of the masses in creating history is consistent with the process of the basic social contradiction movement promoting social progress. In the process of resolving the basic social contradictions, the masses are social forces that conform to the requirements of the development of productive forces, social forces that have the desire to change the old production relations, and social forces that advocate the change of the old social system and old ideas. The general will and actions of the masses represent the direction of historical development, and the social practice of the masses ultimately determines the outcome of historical development.

2. **Creators of material wealth**
The basis for the existence and development of human society is the mode of production of material resources. The broad masses of working people are the main body of material production activities, creating the necessary living materials such as food, clothing, housing and transportation, as well as the material prerequisites for engaging in political, scientific, cultural and artistic activities. The working people, including intellectuals, continuously accumulate and disseminate production experience in the production process, continuously improve and invent production tools, and promote the development of social productivity. With the modernization of the production process and the gradual reduction of heavy physical labor, the mental labor of intellectuals will become more important in production activities. In contemporary society, the status of science and technology in the development of productivity is becoming more and more important, and the role of intellectuals in promoting the progress of social productivity and creating social material wealth will become more prominent.

3. **Creators of spiritual wealth**
The main body of material production activities is the masses, and the main body of spiritual production activities is also the masses. The masses provide the necessary material conditions and facilities for the creation of spiritual wealth through material production practice. The life and practical activities of the masses are the source of the formation and development of all spiritual wealth and spiritual products. The masses also directly participate in the creation of social spiritual wealth. In particular, intellectuals among the masses play a very important role in the process of spiritual production and the creation of social spiritual wealth, among which many great scientists, thinkers and artists have emerged.

4. **The decisive force of social change**
While creating social wealth, the masses also create and transform social relations. The transformation of production relations and the replacement of social systems ultimately depend on the development of productivity, but they will not be realized and completed spontaneously with the development of productivity, but must rely on the power of the masses. In a specific social environment, the masses constantly demand the improvement of production relations by promoting the development of productivity. The masses are the main force of social revolution, and they have played a huge role in the process of social form replacement. "The people, and only the people, are the driving force for creating world history."

### Constraints on the historical activities of the masses

The activities of the masses to create history are constrained by certain social and historical conditions. Economic conditions have a primary and decisive influence on the activities of the masses to create history. The level of productivity achieved in a certain historical stage is the material basis and prerequisite for the masses to create history. In different production relations or economic systems, the economic status, economic interests and role of the masses in the production process are different. Political conditions also have a direct impact on the people's activities of creating history. Under different political systems, the people's political status and political rights are different, and the role they play in politics and other fields is also different. Spiritual and cultural conditions are also an important factor that restricts the people's activities of creating history. People in a certain historical period are always consciously or unconsciously influenced by the ideological and cultural traditions and ideology of a certain society. Negative and backward cultural consciousness will weaken the role of the people in creating history, while advanced science, culture, ideology and morality have a positive role in promoting the people's activities of creating history.

my country's socialist system provides extremely favorable economic, political and cultural conditions for the people's activities of creating history, but there are also aspects that need to be improved and perfected. At present, my country is in and will remain in the primary stage of socialism for a long time, and there are still problems of unbalanced and insufficient development. This requires us to adhere to socialist reform, strengthen economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, social construction, and ecological civilization construction, and further mobilize and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people. From the perspective of the times and history, Xi Jinping summarized and generalized the dominant position and great creative role of the people in the practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and put forward the people-centered development thought, which fully reflects and conforms to the fundamental interests of the people, clearly embodies the political stance and governing philosophy of Marxist parties, embodies the value orientation and work orientation of the Communists, and creatively applies and develops the basic principle of historical materialism that the people create history.
