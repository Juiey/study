# Material dialectics is a scientific method of cognition

**A series of laws and categories of material dialectics reveal the universal laws of universal connection and eternal development of the world. It is not only a scientific world outlook, but also a basic methodology for us to understand and transform the world. To understand the world and think dialectically according to the objective dialectical nature of the world itself and the law of dialectical movement is the purpose and inherent requirement of our study of material dialectics. **

#### The dialectics of cognitive activities

Human cognitive activities themselves must conform to objective dialectics and have their own inherent laws of dialectical movement. The law of the unity of opposites, as the essence and core of material dialectics, provides a methodological basis for people's cognitive activities. The relationships between subject and object, sensibility and rationality, concrete and abstract, individual and general in cognitive activities are all relationships of unity of opposites.

#### The specific laws and methodological significance of materialist dialectics

**1. The law of quantitative change and qualitative change**

The law of quantitative change and qualitative change guides people to combine quantitative analysis and qualitative research in scientific research, and follow the objective process of "quantitative change-qualitative change-new quantitative change" to understand and grasp the stages of the development of things and the transformation of different development states.

**2. The law of negation of negation**

The law of negation of negation tells people that any real thing will realize self-negation in its development process and periodically advance to a higher form of existence. The essence of the development of things and its development direction should be grasped from the unity of progressiveness and tortuosity.

**3. The law of the unity of opposites**

As the core of materialist dialectics, the law of the unity of opposites reveals the internal contradictions of things and their movement and change, and is the fundamental method of understanding and solving problems. Mao Zedong pointed out: "The dialectical worldview mainly teaches people to be good at observing and analyzing the movement of contradictions in various things, and based on this analysis, point out the method of resolving contradictions." The core requirement of the contradiction analysis method is to be good at analyzing the particularity of contradictions, to make concrete analysis of specific contradictions, and to make concrete analysis of specific situations and specific problems.

Lenin pointed out: "The living soul of Marxism: concrete analysis of specific situations." Mao Zedong further pointed out in "On Contradiction": "The most essential thing of Marxism, the living soul of Marxism, lies in the concrete analysis of specific situations." Using the contradiction analysis method of materialist dialectics to study and solve problems requires us to constantly strengthen our awareness of problems, adhere to the concrete analysis of specific problems, be good at recognizing and resolving contradictions, and especially to prioritize the resolution of major contradictions as a breakthrough to open up the situation, so as to drive the resolution of other contradictions.

Xi Jinping emphasized that reform should "grasp the key" and "highlight problem orientation", which reflects the application of the contradiction analysis method in reform and development issues.

#### Adhere to problem orientation

**1. Problem awareness**

Adhering to problem orientation is an important method of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and is the contemporary expression and sublimation of the dialectical materialist view of contradiction and the method of contradiction analysis. Problems are the voice of the times and the concentrated embodiment of contradictions. Discovering problems is equivalent to grasping the contradictions of things. Marx pointed out: "Problems are the open and fearless voices of the times that control all individuals. Problems are the slogans of the times and the most practical calls for it to express its own mental state."

**2. Problem orientation**

A distinctive feature of Marxism is that it has a strong sense of problem throughout, and always pays attention to and answers major practical problems raised by the times and practice. Adhering to problem orientation is the secret of Marxism's eternal vitality. Adhering to problem orientation requires efforts to grasp the focus of resolving contradictions and find new ideas and methods to resolve contradictions. Xi Jinping pointed out clearly: "Problems are the manifestation of contradictions in things. We emphasize strengthening problem awareness and adhering to problem orientation, which means recognizing the universality and objectivity of contradictions, and being good at understanding and resolving contradictions as a breakthrough to open up the work situation."

Adhering to problem orientation, we must not only strengthen problem awareness, but also be good at discovering problems and dare to face them; not only scientifically analyze problems and conduct in-depth research on them, but also be brave to touch contradictions and be good at resolving contradictions, especially being good at flexibly using scientific thinking methods such as dialectical thinking and innovative thinking to solve various complex problems.

#### Summary

As a scientific method of cognition, dialectical materialism requires us to follow the objective dialectical law, use the method of contradiction analysis, focus on problem orientation, analyze specific problems in a specific way, and deal with complex real problems with a scientific attitude and method to achieve a deep understanding of things and effective transformation.
