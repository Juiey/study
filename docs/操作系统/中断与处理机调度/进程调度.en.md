## Process Scheduling

Process scheduling is a low-level scheduling that is responsible for selecting a process from multiple ready processes, allocating CPU, and allowing it to run. Its goal is to efficiently utilize the CPU and meet the performance requirements of the system.

## Main functions of process scheduling

**Selecting a process**:

- Select a process that is most suitable for the current operation from the ready queue and allocate the CPU to it.

**Managing CPU allocation**:

- Dynamically adjust the CPU allocation strategy so that CPU resources can be reasonably shared among processes.

**Save and restore process context**:

- When switching CPU control, save the running state (context) of the current process;

- Restore the running state of the scheduled process so that it can continue to run.

**Fairness and priority control**:

- Ensure that all processes can compete fairly for the CPU;

- Reasonably allocate the CPU according to scheduling strategies such as priority and urgency.

**Support multiple scheduling algorithms**:

- Support multiple algorithms such as first-come-first-served (FCFS), time slice rotation, and high response ratio priority (HRRF) to adapt to different system requirements.

## Timing of process scheduling

Process scheduling is usually triggered in the following situations:

**Process running ends**:

- The current process has finished executing, the CPU is idle, and a new process needs to be scheduled to run.

**Process enters the blocked state**:

- The current process cannot continue to run due to I/O requests, waiting for resources, etc., and switches from the running state to the blocked state, and schedules other processes to run.

**Time slice is exhausted (in time-sharing system)**:

- The time slice of the current process is exhausted, triggering process switching and allocating the CPU to the next process.

**Priority preemption**:

- In preemptive scheduling, when a higher priority process enters the ready queue, the current running process will be interrupted and the CPU will be allocated to the high priority process.

**Process changes from the blocked state to the ready state**:

- After the event that the blocking process is waiting for is completed, it will re-enter the ready state, which may trigger the scheduling of a new process.

**Return after the system call is completed**:

- After the system call or other system tasks are completed, the user process may need to be rescheduled.
