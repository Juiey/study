### Deadlock prevention and avoidance strategies

| Method | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------|------|------|------|
| **Deadlock prevention** | Static strategy, by pre-restricting the resource application of the process to reduce the possibility of deadlock. | Simple and intuitive, ensuring that deadlock is avoided from the beginning. | Poor flexibility may lead to reduced resource utilization and even resource waste. |
| **Deadlock avoidance** | Dynamic strategy, allowing processes to dynamically apply for resources, but performing security checks before allocation to prevent the system from entering an unsafe state. | Flexible, dynamic resource allocation can avoid deadlock. | The analysis and calculation of resource application is complex, the system overhead is large, and it is difficult to accurately grasp the maximum number of resources required by each process. |

### Deadlock avoidance strategies and methods

| Strategy | Method | Working principle |
|------|------|------|
| **Banker's algorithm** | Deadlock avoidance algorithm, used to determine whether the system is still in a safe state after allocating resources. | Before allocating resources each time, the system checks whether there are enough resources to meet the current request; if the system is still safe after allocating the resource, the allocation is allowed, otherwise the request is rejected. |
| **Safety check when requesting resources** | Checks are performed when dynamically allocating resources to ensure that an unsafe state is not entered. | The system checks whether the resource request of the process will cause a deadlock, and if it is safe, the request is allowed, otherwise it is rejected. |
