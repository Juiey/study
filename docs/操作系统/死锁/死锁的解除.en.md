When the deadlock detection program detects the existence of a deadlock, it should try to resolve it and let the system recover from the deadlock state. Common methods for resolving deadlocks include:

| Method | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Immediately terminate all processes | Terminate the execution of all processes and restart the operating system | Simple | Large losses, all previous work is invalid |
| Cancel all deadlocked processes | Cancel all processes involved in the deadlock and continue to run after the deadlock is resolved | Can completely destroy the deadlock's circular waiting condition | High cost, may cause some important processes to be terminated, the work done by the process will be lost, and the recovery process is troublesome. |
| Cancel deadlocked processes one by one | Cancel processes involved in deadlock one by one, and reclaim their resources until the deadlock is resolved | Flexible, you can choose the revocation order according to the process characteristics | Need to determine which processes to revoke first, which may be complicated |
| Grab resources | Grab resources from processes involved in deadlock and reallocate them to other processes | Can resolve deadlock without terminating the process | May cause instability in other processes, so be careful |

**Selection of conditions for revoking deadlocked processes one by one**

When revoking deadlocked processes one by one, you can select processes that meet the following conditions to be revoked first:

- The one that consumes the least CPU time

- The one that generates the least output
- The one with the longest estimated remaining execution time
- The one that occupies the least number of resources
- The one with the lowest priority

This method can resolve deadlocks with minimal impact by flexibly selecting the processes to be revoked.
