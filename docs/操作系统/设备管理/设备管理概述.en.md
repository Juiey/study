In modern computer systems, a large number of different types of **peripheral devices** are configured, including devices for information input, output and storage and corresponding device controllers. In large and medium-sized computer systems, input/output channels are usually also equipped. Peripheral devices in computer systems are usually called **I/O devices**. Due to the large differences in the **physical characteristics**, **operation mode**, **operation speed**, **control mode**, **data representation** and **transmission unit** of these devices, the management of peripheral devices by the operating system is diverse and complex.

## Device classification

With the development of personal computers, workstations and computer networks since the 1980s, peripheral devices have become more diverse, complex and intelligent. External devices can be classified from different perspectives:

**Classification by working characteristics**

- **Storage devices**: such as hard disks, solid-state drives, optical disks, etc., used for data storage.

- **Input/output devices**: such as keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, etc., used for data input and output.

**Classification by usage nature**

- **Exclusive devices**: devices that can only be used by one process at a time, such as printers and CD burners.
- **Shared devices**: devices that can be used by multiple processes at the same time, such as disks and network devices.
- **Virtual devices**: devices simulated by software technology, such as virtual printers and virtual disks.

**Classification by data transmission method**

- **Serial devices**: data is transmitted bit by bit, such as serial mice and serial printers.
- **Parallel devices**: data is transmitted in multiple bits at the same time, such as parallel printers and parallel scanners (gradually replaced by serial devices).

## Device management function

The main purpose of device management in modern computer systems is to **facilitate user use**, provide users with **unified peripheral device interfaces**, and **improve the efficiency of I/O devices** to enhance the parallel processing capabilities of the system. The main functions of device management include:

1. **Device allocation and deallocation**: manage the allocation and release of devices in the system so that multiple processes can use device resources reasonably.

2. **Device startup**: control the startup and initialization of peripheral devices so that the system and users can access the devices.

3. **Disk drive scheduling**: optimize the scheduling of disk read and write operations to improve disk access efficiency.
4. **Device processing**: handle device interruptions, errors and exceptions to ensure normal device operation.
5. **Virtual device implementation**: simulate device functions through software technology to realize the use of virtual devices.
