## Four-level structure of I/O system
- **Typical structure**: including host, channel, device controller, input/output device.

## Classification and performance of I/O devices
- **Classification by transmission rate**:

- **Low-speed devices**: such as keyboards and mice, with low transmission rates (several bytes to hundreds of bytes per second).
- **Medium-speed devices**: such as printers, with medium transmission rates (thousands to tens of thousands of bytes per second).
- **High-speed devices**: such as disks and optical disks, with high transmission rates (hundreds of thousands to tens of megabytes per second).

- **Classification by information exchange unit**:

- **Block devices**: exchange information in blocks (such as disks), characterized by high transmission rate, addressable, and commonly used DMA methods.

- **Character devices**: exchange information in characters (such as keyboards and printers), characterized by low transmission rate, unaddressable, and commonly used interrupt-driven methods.

- **Classification by sharing attributes**:

- **Exclusive devices**: such as printers, require static allocation.
- **Shared devices**: such as disks, can be used alternately by multiple jobs.
- **Virtual device**: simulate exclusive devices through virtual technology.

## Device controller
- **Interface line**: includes data line, control line and status line.

- **Function**:

- **Accept and identify commands**.

- **Data exchange**.

- **Report device status**.

- **Address recognition**.

- **Data buffer**.

- **Error control**.

- **Interface with CPU and device**: communicate through data line, address line and control line.

## Channel (I/O processor)
- **Function**: execute I/O instructions, control I/O operations, support parallel processing and improve system efficiency.

- **Type**:

- **Byte multiplex channel**: process in bytes and connect a large number of low-speed devices.

- **Array selection channel**: process in blocks and high-speed devices occupy the channel exclusively.

- **Array multiplex channel**: multi-programming to improve channel utilization and transmission rate.
- **Bottleneck problem and solution**: Improve channel efficiency and system reliability by adding multiple cross-connections.

## Bus system
- **Function**: Connect CPU, memory and I/O devices to realize information transmission.
- **Bus type**:

- **ISA bus**: Early PC bus, 8-bit/16-bit structure.
- **EISA bus**: Extended ISA bus, double-layer socket design, compatible with ISA.
- **VESA bus**: Local bus, 32-bit/64-bit data line, high-speed transmission.
- **PCI bus**: Support 32-bit/64-bit, burst read and write operations, high transmission rate.
- **PCI-Express**: Replace PCI bus, support higher bandwidth and scalability.
