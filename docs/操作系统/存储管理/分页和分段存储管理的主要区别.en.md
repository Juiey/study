## Logical and physical units
- **Paging**: Pages are **physical units**, which are mainly established for the system's memory management needs and do not consider the logical structure of the program.
- **Segmentation**: Segments are **logical units**, and each segment contains a relatively complete set of logically meaningful information. Segmentation management is designed to better meet the needs of programmers and the structure of the program.

## Fixed size
- **Paging**: The size of a page is **fixed**, determined by the operating system or hardware, so all pages have the same size in the entire system.
- **Segmentation**: The size of a segment is **unfixed**, defined by the programmer or determined by the compiler based on the logical structure of the program, and the sizes of different segments can be different.

## Structure of address space
- **Paging**: The job address space in a paging system is **one-dimensional**, and the logical address of each page is continuous, that is, the address within the page is continuous.
- **Segmentation**: The job address space in a segmentation system is **two-dimensional**, and the addresses between segments are **discontinuous**, because each segment is divided according to logic, and there is no continuity between segments.
