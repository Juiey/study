File management is an important functional module in modern operating systems, mainly responsible for managing user information, including storage, retrieval, update, sharing and protection.

## Files and file systems

- **File** is the basic unit for storing information in the operating system. Files have the following main attributes:
- **Basic attributes**: file name, file size, creation time, etc.
- **Type attributes**: file type, such as text files, binary files, etc.
- **Protection attributes**: permission settings, such as read-only, readable and writable, executable, etc.
- **Management attributes**: file path, owner, group, etc.
- **Control attributes**: Access control list (ACL), lock status, etc.

- **File system** is a software system in the operating system responsible for accessing and managing file information. Its main functions include:
- **System function**: manage file storage, retrieval, and update. Provide a safe and reliable sharing and protection mechanism. Provide users with a convenient operation interface.
- **System perspective**: The function of the file system is to manage the storage of files, and retrieve, protect, organize and allocate storage space for files.
- **User perspective**: The function of the file system is to achieve "access by name", that is, users can access files through file names.

## File classification

- **Classification by nature and purpose**:
- **System files**: operating system core files and configuration files.
- **Library files**: shared program libraries or dynamic link libraries (DLLs).
- **User files**: files created by users, such as documents, pictures, etc.

- **Classification by protection level**:
- **Read-only files**: only reading is allowed, not modification.
- **Read-write files**: reading and modification are allowed.
- **Executable files**: executable program files.
- **Unprotected files**: files without permission protection.

- **Classification by information flow**:
- **Input files**: files that obtain input data from external devices or systems.
- **Output files**: files that output data to external devices or systems.
- **Input and output files**: files used for both input and output.

- **Classification by storage time limit**:
- **Temporary files**: used to temporarily store data, with a short life cycle.
- **Permanent files**: files that are stored for a long time.
- **Archive files**: important files used for archiving and storage.

- **Classification by data form**:
- **Ordinary files**: Contains text, binary data, etc.
- **Directory files**: used to store organizational information of files and directories.
- **Special files**: files that represent devices, pipes, etc.

## Functions of the file system

- **Directory management**: Organize files through directory structure to achieve access by name.

- **File organization**:
- **Logical structure**: File structure from the user's perspective, such as flat files and tree files.
- **Physical structure**: File layout on storage devices, such as continuous allocation and chain allocation.
- **File storage space management**: responsible for the allocation and release of auxiliary storage space (disk, etc.).
- **File operations**: including basic operations such as creating, opening, reading, writing, closing, and deleting files.
- **File sharing, protection, and confidentiality**: Provide permission control and encryption mechanisms to ensure the security and privacy of files.

## Hierarchical structure of file system

File system is usually divided into the following three levels:

- **Description layer**: responsible for describing the usage status of all files and storage media in the system. For example, metadata of the file system, file directory structure, etc.
- **Management layer**: the core part of the file system, mainly including:
- **Device driver management**: manage drivers related to storage devices.
- **Physical I/O control**: handle low-level input/output operations.
- **File storage organization**: manage the organization of files on physical storage media.
- **Logical I/O management**: provide a logical view of files and shield the low-level storage details.
- **Interface layer**: provide users with interfaces for operating file systems, including command interfaces (such as CLI commands) and program interfaces (such as API calls).
