## File storage structure and usage
- The storage structure of a file is not only related to the physical characteristics of the storage device, but also to how users use the file.
- Files are stored in secondary storage space. When a file is accessed, it must be read from secondary storage into main memory.

## File table
- **System open file table**: The entire system provides a system open file table to track all files in use.
- **User Open File Table**: Each user has a user open file table, which is used to track the files that the user is using.
- **Shared files**: When multiple processes share the same file, the open file tables of multiple users must correspond to the same entry address of the system's open file table.
