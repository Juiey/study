The organizational structure and access method of files determine the layout of files on the storage medium and how the operating system accesses and processes these file data.

## File access method

Based on the order of accessing file information, file access methods can be divided into the following types:

1. **Sequential access**:
- Read and write the information in the file in sequence.
- Typical device: tape, suitable for processing large batches of sequentially read data.
- Advantages: simple and low operating cost.
- Disadvantages: can only be accessed sequentially, low efficiency, and does not support random access.

2. **Random access** (direct access):
- Information in the file can be read and written randomly in any order without sequential access.
- Typical device: disk, which can directly locate the physical address of the file according to the logical position for operation.
- Advantages: fast access speed and high flexibility.
- Disadvantages: complex implementation, suitable for small files or files that need to be read frequently randomly.

3. **Key access**:
- Access files according to a given key (primary key or record name). - The logical location of the corresponding record must be retrieved first, and then converted into a physical address on the storage medium for access.
- Commonly used for file operations in database systems.

4. **Factors for selecting access methods**:
- **Nature of the file**: It is divided into streaming files and record files.
- **Characteristics of storage devices**: For example, tapes are suitable for sequential access, and disks are suitable for random access.

## Logical structure of files

The logical structure of a file describes the logical organization of the file, which is mainly divided into the following two categories:

- **Streaming file (unstructured file)**:
- Logically, it is a continuous string of characters without internal structure.
- Commonly seen in text files and binary files.

- **Record file (structured file)**:
- It consists of several logical records, each of which is an independent basic unit of information.
- Different logical records are distinguished by primary keys (such as ID).
- Includes the following types:
1. **Sequential file**: Records are stored and accessed in sequence.
2. **Index file**: Fast retrieval and access are achieved by creating indexes.
3. **Indexed sequential file**: Combines the advantages of sequential files and indexed files.
4. **Direct file**: Random access is achieved by directly accessing the physical address of the record.
5. **Hash file**: Use hash functions to quickly locate records, suitable for fast search operations.

## Physical structure of files

The physical structure of a file describes the actual organization of the file on the storage medium, which mainly includes the following:

1. **Sequential structure**:
- Files are stored continuously on the storage medium, and logical records are stored in adjacent physical blocks in sequence.
- Advantages: High efficiency of sequential reading and writing.
- Disadvantages: Easy to generate fragmentation and cannot support random access.

2. **Link structure**:
- Records in the file are linked together by pointers and do not need to be stored continuously on the storage medium.
- Advantages: Reduce fragmentation problems and support dynamic expansion.
- Disadvantages: Low random access efficiency and need to traverse pointers one by one.

3. **Index structure**:
- Create an index table for the file and find the physical address of the file record through the index table.
- Advantages: fast retrieval speed, suitable for large files and complex search operations.
- Disadvantages: additional storage space is required to store index tables.

4. **Direct file**:
- For record-based files, the corresponding physical address is directly located through the primary key.
- Advantages: fast access, suitable for frequent random access scenarios.
- Disadvantages: need to design efficient mapping functions to avoid address conflicts.

## Grouping and decomposition of records

- **Grouping of records**:
- Multiple logical records are combined into one physical block for storage.
- **Block factor**: The number of logical records contained in a physical block.
- Advantages: Reduce the number of I/O operations and improve data transmission efficiency.

- **Decomposition of records**:
- The operation of separating a single logical record from a physical block.
- Commonly used to read and process physical blocks containing multiple logical records.
