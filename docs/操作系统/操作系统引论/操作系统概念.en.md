## Computer system consists of hardware and software.

**Hardware** refers to the physical device of the computer itself, which is the basis for software establishment and activities.

**Software** Software is a program executed by the computer, which manages the hardware and expands its functions.

**Operating system** belongs to **system** software, which is an important program for managing computer hardware and software resources, organizing and controlling the operation of the entire system. The operating system assists hardware and application software by providing various system programs (such as editing and connecting programs) and system maintenance programs (such as error checking and diagnostic programs).

## Software classification

Computer software is divided into three categories:

- **System software**: operating system, compiler, programming language, connection assembly program and programs closely related to computer.

- **Application software**: such as application programs and specific function software packages.

- **Tool software**: such as diagnostic and boot programs, used for system maintenance.

> **The operating system organically combines various software and hardware resources in the system into a whole, so that the computer truly reflects the integrity and availability of the system.**

## The purpose of the operating system

- **From the management perspective**: Rationally organize computer workflow, manage and allocate resources, and realize multi-user sharing.
- **From the user's perspective**: Provide a friendly interface so that users can easily use the computer without knowing the hardware details.

## Definition of operating system (what is an operating system)

> **The operating system is a system software (or a collection of programs) that controls and manages various hardware and software resources within the computer system and effectively organizes the operation of multiple programs. It is the interface between the user and the computer.**

**The main goals include**:

- Convenience for users: Provide a friendly user interface.
- Expand machine functions: Add hardware functions and new services.
- Manage system resources: Make full use of hardware and software resources.
- Improve system efficiency: Optimize processes and performance.
- Build an open environment: Support scalability and interoperability.

## Goals of operating systems

**Efficient, convenient, safe, robust, and portable**
