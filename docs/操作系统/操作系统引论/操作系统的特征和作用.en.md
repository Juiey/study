## Basic features of operating systems

### 1. **Concurrency**

- **Parallelism**: refers to two or more events occurring at the same time.

- **Concurrency**: refers to two or more events occurring within the same time interval.

- In a multi-programming environment, concurrency refers to the simultaneous running of multiple programs within a period of time at a macro level

- In a single-processor system, only one program can be executed at a time, and these programs are executed alternately at a micro level

### 2. **Sharing**

- Sharing means that the resources in the system can be used by multiple concurrently executed processes.

- **Sharing mode**:

- **Mutually exclusive sharing**: resources can only be used by one process at a time.

- **Simultaneous access**: resources can be accessed by multiple processes at the same time.

> **Concurrency and sharing are the core features of the operating system, and the two are mutually dependent conditions for existence. **

### 3. **Virtualization**

- Virtualization refers to the conversion of a physical resource into multiple logical counterparts through technical means. For example, virtual memory technology expands physical memory into a larger logical memory

### 4. **Asynchronous**

- Usually the execution of a process is not "in one go", but runs in a "stop-and-go" manner

- The asynchronicity of the process is an important feature of the operating system

## The role of the operating system

- As an interface between the user and the computer hardware system
- As a manager of computer system resources
- Used to expand the machine
