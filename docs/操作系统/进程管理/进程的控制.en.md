### Process life cycle

**Generate, run, pause, terminate**

### Process control

The operating system manages the state transition of the process through process control primitives. Common process control operations include:

1. **Process creation**:

- Create a new process, allocate necessary resources to it, and initialize PCB.

- After creation, the process enters the **ready state**, waiting for the scheduler to allocate CPU time.

2. **Process cancellation**:

- Cancel (terminate) the process, reclaim the resources occupied by the process, and remove its PCB from the system.

- Termination reasons may include normal program termination, user active termination, abnormal errors, etc.

3. **Process blocking**:

- During the running process, if the process needs to wait for an event (such as I/O completion, signal arrival), it enters the **blocking state**.

- After the process is blocked, the CPU will be released to allow other processes to execute.

4. **Process wakeup**:

- When the event that the blocked process is waiting for occurs, the process is awakened and enters the **ready state**.
- The wake-up operation is usually triggered by the operating system or other processes.

5. **Change process priority number**:

- Adjust the priority of the process to change the priority of the process when scheduling.

- A process with a higher priority will be scheduled for execution earlier than a process with a lower priority.

6. **Process scheduling**:

- Select a process from the ready queue, switch it to the **running state**, and start execution.

- The scheduler selects the appropriate process based on the scheduling algorithm (such as first-come-first-served, priority scheduling, time slice rotation, etc.).

### Four process control primitives

In the operating system, the four commonly used process control primitives include:

#### 1. **Process blocking (Block)**

- **Function**: Convert a process in the running state to the blocked state.

- **Trigger condition**: When a process performs I/O operations and waits for an event (such as a semaphore), it needs to enter the blocked state.

#### 2. **Process wakeup (Wakeup)**

- **Function**: Convert a process in the blocked state to the ready state.
- **Trigger condition**: When the waiting event occurs (such as I/O completion, resource availability), the process is awakened and re-enters the ready state.

#### 3. **Process creation (Create)**

- **Function**: Create a new process and set it to the ready state.

- **Trigger condition**: When the system or user needs to create a new task, the process creation primitive is called.

#### 4. **Process scheduling (Dispatch/Schedule)**

- **Function**: Switch the process in the ready state to the running state.

- **Trigger condition**: When the CPU is idle or the time slice ends, the scheduler selects a process from the ready queue to execute.
