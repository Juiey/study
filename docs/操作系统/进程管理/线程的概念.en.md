### Overview of threads

**Threads are independent running units that are smaller than processes.**

- **Thread** is an execution unit in a process and is the basic unit of operating system scheduling.

- Threads are entities in a process. A process can contain multiple threads, which share the resources of the process but can execute independently.

#### Thread properties

- **Multiple threads can execute concurrently**

- **A thread can create another thread**

- **Threads are dynamic**

- **Each thread also has its own data structure, namely the thread control block**

- **In the same process, each thread shares the same address space (that is, the storage space of the process to which it belongs)**

- **Threads in one process are invisible in another process**

- **Communication between threads in the same process is mainly based on global variables**
