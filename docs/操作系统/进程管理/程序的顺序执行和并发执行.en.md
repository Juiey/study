**Characteristics of sequential execution of programs**:

1. **Sequentiality**: The program is executed strictly in steps, and each action starts after the previous action is completed.

2. **Closedness**: The running environment of the program is only affected by its own actions and is not interfered by external factors.

3. **Reproducibility**: Under the same initial conditions, the program has the same execution results each time, regardless of the execution speed.

**Characteristics of concurrent execution of programs**:

1. **Intermittency**: Concurrently executed programs may restrict each other due to shared resources or task collaboration, forming an intermittent activity mode of "execution-pause-execution".

2. **Loss of closure**: Concurrent programs share system resources, and the execution speed and control conversion are affected by external factors, resulting in the running environment no longer being closed.

3. **Irreproducibility**: After losing closure, concurrently executed programs may obtain different execution results under the same initial conditions.
